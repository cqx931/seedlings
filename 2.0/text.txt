When the language underneath our words starts to rot, we get meaning compost. The thought peels and shells and seeds we discard daily break down into phosphate:rich combinations of sounds that encode objective, though not true accounts of mental processes. Contrary to the common belief, none of the unconscious we spit out ever disappears. There’s a complex cycle, akin to that of water or sunlight, that products of the mind follow—at the end of the day, the mind itself is just another fruit of the Earth. Try listening to the life your writings lived before they passed through you. Hear the earthworms coming to reclaim every sentence you utter, the fungi growing over everything your senses touch.

Spell to be spoken: Come to me, you who drew up
lines on the land like a butcher on a live animal, and
behold your form being erased. Bring something new
into this heavy sphere, you who don’t believe it is futile to try making anything from scratch. Look at the drops of water sliding down the window, the boats sailing across the ocean, the yellow leaves responding to the wind with a switch in point of view. Stop them all if you can. Stop plants from walking up and down the continent, and breaking through concrete sidewalks, and bursting open empty homes. Come to me, and open your ears to those who switch up words on paper and on screens.

Who are we? Hungry beetles who have never been to the region where the wind sprouts? Apple variations who feel the air caress us as we walk about the country? Did we sit in front of the TV stringing thoughts like beads for a necklace? Kissing knives, feeling superstitious of frogs, of dresses, of eggs, of fluids? Or did we go off thinking we knew ourselves and came back translated? Are we working yet on telling a fortune? Collaborating with fellow lumps of glass to cook a dish better than what we’ve been getting? Siding with potatoes, peppers, and other independent thinkers and sorters? Will we uproot the death warning that sucks the crickets out of our blood? And inhabit the lake again, befriend the bugs, harvest the salt, place an onion under our beds?

There is so much space we manage to grow in every direction without pause and still have plenty of air around us, bottomless god to be alone in, to feel like there is distance between us and the other beings that grow. To from something we know find the unknown. To start with one drop and turn into an ocean.
